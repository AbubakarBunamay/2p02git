# Abstract

To use Facebook, we are shown and having to agree to policies and agreements kept in place. These policies and agreements are meant to protect but nearly all users never read what is in them or what do they really have in control, this in the end brings up rumours and different information with how our data is used. By using Voyant we can analyse Facebook policies to understand in a better and a quicker sense to what they really do with the users data. We can encounter differences and occurrence that can show what they really mean behind the users eyes.

# Introduction

Almost everyone is on Facebook now, from our loving pets creating their account to share pictures to business trying to bring awareness and increase sales are on Facebook. We can see that now Facebook isn’t what it used to be anymore, generally it asked few questions to build an account and start socializing but now extra steps are implemented that aren’t like they used to. As Mark Zuckerberg Stated Facebook will always be free, but in reality, there is a cost. In this report, it will go through in finding out what the cost is.

Through the goal of publicly engaged humanities reading, we can see through that Facebook achieves the 5 goals and on a history track with that, we can receive news, crisis and even a neighbour’s pet birthday delivered in our fingertips at an instant. How does this work and why is this free to use? These are the right questions to ask. Through from just connecting with your collogues to now connecting the world in just an instant is such a revolutionary technology. These policies and agreement are kept in place to provide a friendly and safe environment to its users but Facebook offers a notice within 7 days of releasing a change in its policy to all users, and gives them an opportunity to comment on the change. However, if users continue to use Facebook they demonstrate their user consent, and failure to read the notice is not Facebook’s fault.

We can also see through the reading of Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display, we need to design to make sense or bring the context to the purpose of the page. Seeing Facebook page a few years back before updating to a much better visual we can indicate the tools had various assumptions but only known truly with the Facebook team. 

A privacy policy is set to imply trust between Facebook and its users, but looking carefully shows Facebook is protecting itself more than its users. Facebook trusts its users to be honest by providing their real personal information and to keep it up to date, to not create another account, to not have multiple accounts and to not transfer their account without written consent from Facebook. This all some of the information put in place and shows that it harvests your information.

In this experiment using Voyant to understand the Facebook policies and the way back machine to see any changes and improvement that they have done in the recent years. We can encounter differences and occurrence that can show what they really mean and we were supposed to interpret them even though the truth is hidden behind our eyes. 


# Methods

The tools that are to be using will be a Voyant tool called terms berry and document tree. A tool in the internet archive called way back machine. The tools used will help analyze the text occurrence and be able to analyse what it really means. The tools will also enable to relate the relation and with its content everywhere in the document. 
  
!["Fig1: A closer look of TermBerry"](./t1.png)

!["Fig2: A closer look of Document Terms"](./d1.png)

A document terms(fig1) are shown in a table format in the occurrence of the terms. We can see the term, it’s frequency and a graph that shows the distributions of the term within the different parts of the document. We see information being the first here as we realise now Facebook is built on information gathered from people. The use of products terms indicated their use of their product and what we can do.

Terms berry(fig2) shows the most frequent terms with how those same terms cooccur. The highest one stays in the middle, but we can see information and products being the middle here, which means it is about the information and the products in Facebook, the information and these products help Facebook target the one interested in the particular activity in relation with their profile.


!["Fig3: A closer look of WaybackMachine"](./3.png)

With the wayback machine(fig3) we can use it to recall the previous policies before any updates, wayback machine crawls the web by looking at webpages and archiving them, it takes snapshot of a webpage and stores it. 

With the tools and the methods will show what the document and the information it holds and where users are in that space. As we can see so far, Facebook is protecting themselves as seen on the figure introducing document terms where occurrence of people is not as much as them. The propagation of making Facebook smart and user directed ads made many users believe Facebook is listening but failing to understand that Facebook system in showing the ads. Many believe this and think Facebook hears all your conversations and tries to sell you behind your back.

People are already rising now and are unhappy with the supposed exploitation of information, agreements and other opportunities from the Facebook side. There is a hashtag going on about a movement to those invested in their own privacy are increasingly concerned in using their platforms.

# Results

The cost of using Facebook is now revealed analysed, we will use three terms which are people, information and product as there are closely tied to the user and understand the price they are paying.

Comparing the result of the policy dated back in 2005(fig4) to the latest policy seeing the change is inevitable. How much has change from their development and how they process and function today.

Starting with information,

!["Fig5: Voyant Analysis of both the links"](./2.png)

Information(fig5) is everything, this is why it's a great place to start, seeing the trend with the new Facebook having such a high rate of nearly 0.26 than the old policy starts to make sense and start to look on the contexts. The context does shows what our eyes have missed,Facebook collects information is whatever you done as long as you are on Facebook.

With people(fig6), a whole new chapter gets open as it tends to generally relate to users or people access their systems one way or another, with one person can have an effect towards millions. Looking at the frequency again seeing the difference on how it has change and we can see it
openly on how they take information from people.

Lastly is looking at products(fig7), based on the research it is fair to look at what Facebook offers as a product. What do they really mean when they mention product, do the mean the network, app or just Facebook?

!["Fig6: Voyant Analysis of both the links"](./4.png)

By products it is identified that it is Facebook or currently known as meta and they are in the end protecting themselves accordingly. The
context shows some promotion as well as more of the Facebook tools leading to the meaning of the products.

Based on the result found, we can see how Facebook policy is staged around them and not the users. Some have gone far as trying to sue
Facebook for misuse of the data but based on the policies and agreements that you haven't read; would you really have a leg to stand on?

Discussion:

As seen with the results, we start seeing that it's not really about the people its about them. They are guarding themselves, looking back at
March 2018 when users brought concern when it had been documenting their calls and messages, Facebook replied by stating that the users had opted in. The user accepting privacy policy in the matter of 7 days and if you
just ignore and still use the service that means you have accepted. The real cost of all this is information. information being the most
valuable commodity. We can see how literally now everything start with a free version online and when you join your information gets in circled,
share and use to their profits.

March 2018 when users brought concern when it had been documenting their calls and messages, Facebook replied by stating that the users had opted in. This is back towards accepting privacy policy in the matter of 7 days and if you just ignore and still use the service that means you
have accepted. The real cost of all this is information, information being the most valuable commodity. We can see how literally now
everything start with a free version online and when you join your information gets in circlet.

So, what is information and how do they benefit, these allegations and acquisition will never stop with Facebook but strange enough we do not
stop using it we find ourself one way or another in that loop either now in Instagram and WhatsApp too. The information is getting sold and
traded for their benefit and increasing a system powerful enough. Digital platforms are not like how they used to be and changing their
goals to maximize their profits. With new technology and algorithms, the platforms are surely getting better and smarter to get us hooked on
ends, the longer we are on the platforms the more profits we help them generate.

Facebook is not about connecting people anymore and yet they are they are called leader in our current digital space. It is near impossible
now to build something similar to Facebook for a digital platform to work like it Facebook does. This is scary on not knowing what our
information is being used for and what difference you make in the line of thousands of people just like you trying to connect with your loved
ones or just catching up on some news or entertaining yourself. You end up getting multiple ads of various things matching your interests, you
might say Facebook is built for me but in reality, it is just how it works by getting various datapoints like mentioned on my results on
people through using Voyant to analyse the Facebook policies, start to look at it this way, if you would not like a stranger to have your
selfie, then why share on Facebook Platforms.
